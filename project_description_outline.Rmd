## PHS Dashboard

##### _General outline:_ <br>

The project is to create a dashboard using R-Shiny to consider the impact that winter may have on the acute health care in Scotland using Public Health Scotland data. A secondary objective is to evaluate the possible effect that the pandemic may have had.

The team created an R-Shiny app which allows the user to explore the PHS dataset.

##### _The main points the team were exploring:_ <br>
* To what extent is the ‘winter crisis’ the media predicts real?
* How has winter impacted NHS Scotland’s hospital system in the past?
* How might the pandemic influence the potential scenario?

Data was sourced from Public Health Scotland.

## Stages of the project

1. Preliminary data exploration

2. Picking data-sets to focus on and brainstorming ideas

3. Trello planning layout and task delegation 

4. Skeleton for ShinyApp set up to be filled

5. Cleaning and wrangling the chosen datasets and importing to Shiny

6. Git branching & version control, everyone working on their own branch and later merging with main

7. Adding plots and functionality to the dashboard within the server and UI

## Tools and packages used in the project

* Zoom - The team had daily stand-ups and meetings using

* Git/GitHub - for version control and collaborating together using.

* Trello - The team planned and set tasks using 

* Slack - used for communication outside Zoom meetings

* RStudio - The packages used in this project are as follows:
  + shiny
  + shinyWidgets
  + janitor
  + tidyverse
  + leaflet
  + infer
  + shinydashboard
  + sf
  + rgdal
  + lubridate
  + rmapshaper
  
## Gathering and synthesising requirements for the project

* We synthesized the information given in the brief by assigning team members
to look at datasets and find specific KPI's we could focus on in the ShinyApp.
These KPI's then formed the tabs in the ShinyApp, which were further broken down 
by specific filters. We were able to use ggplot to show time series, filters to break
down demographics and leaflet to show geospatial data.

* We decided to focus the app on bed occupancy rates, hospital admissions, A&E attendances and demographics.

## Motivations for using the chosen data

* **Bed occupancy rates** were used because they show a 'winter effect', i.e.
the summer and winter occupancy rates are significantly different. In addition,
bed occupancy rates are often talked about in the media and in relation to COVID and
the winter crises that NHS hospitals face and are a potentially good marker 
for the whole acute care system.

* **Hospital admissions** were used as they clearly break down by specialty.
We are able to see if there was a rise in infectious disease admissions
which will reflect the COVID and winter crises. 

* **A&E attendances** was chosen to answer the question, are there rises in attendances around 
the winter months as opposed to the summer months. The data could further be effectively broken
down to reflect each year and therefore show post-COVID affects and seasonality.

* **Demographics** were chosen as this data-set was needed to answer the final of the three
different aspects we needed to look at aside from temporal and geographic. We are able 
to see which age groups are most affected in comparison to one another. 

## Data quality and potential bias, including a brief summary of data cleaning and transformations

* The Data is taken from PHS open data, which is a National Statistics Publication therby
meaning this publication must meet the "highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value. The  publication fully complies with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics"

* The datasets not likely to be biased because as "This publication has been assigned a low risk of data quality concerns." 

* Not much cleaning of the datasets was required as PHS data is already clean and in the standard tidy and long format, appropriate for analysis.

* The data was wrangled in various ways:
  + years, quarters and months were mutated from the date provided.
  + a winter flag was mutated in to better compare the winter or summer months and thus look for evidence of a winter crisis.
  + The health board column was changed to show the name of the given health board instead of a code.

## How the data is stored and structued

* The data is in the form of linked data. This means that the structure of the database is contained within the data.

* Any data point in a linked dataset should have a unique identifier which is a URL.

* Benefits of storing the data like this, are that the data points can be browsed using a web
browser and can be referenced to other linked datasets.

## Ethical and legal considerations

**Ethical considerations**

* There few ethical considerations, as the data is fully anonymous, respecting patient privacy.

* A niche case whereby ethical considerations should be made, is if life insurance companies operating in Scotland use this data to skew their policies and target certain demographics in particular regions.

* Security of the data is not an issue, as all PHS data is open. Anyone can access the datasets.

* The data perhaps does not respect patients adequate consent to take anonymous data in the first place. However, people can register a "National Data Opt-out" to prevent NHS Digital from
sharing your identifiable patient data. 

**Legal considerations**

* The datasets are covered by the Open Government License, which means we can copy, publish, adapt and transmit the information. We are also able to use this data commercially and non-commercially. However, we must acknowledge the source of the information.
